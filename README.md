## [PA04](pa04)
We converted pa03 that was built with python and SQL, to a NoSQL based, fully working web application. To interact with the database, we set up API endpoints and middlewares with Express.js and present the data with EJS template format. 

- Framwork: Express.JS
- Libraries: Mongoose
- Language: JavaScript
- Template: EJS
