# create a Python class Transaction in a new file transaction.py which will store financial transactions with the fields. 
# It should have an __init__ method where you pass in the filename for the database to be used (e.g. tracker.db) 
# and each transaction should have the following fields stored in a SQL table called transactions.

# 'item #',
# 'amount',
# 'category',
# 'date',
# 'description'

# It should be similar to the Todolist ORM from Lesson 19 in class. It will allow the user to read and update the database as need.
# The transaction class should not do any printing!!
