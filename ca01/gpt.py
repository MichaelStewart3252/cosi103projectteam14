'''
Demo code for interacting with GPT-3 in Python.

To run this you need to 
* first visit openai.com and get an APIkey, 
* which you export into the environment as shown in the shell code below.
* next create a folder and put this file in the folder as gpt.py
* finally run the following commands in that folder

On Mac
% pip3 install openai
% export APIKEY="......."  # in bash
% python3 gpt.py

On Windows:
% pip install openai
% $env:APIKEY="....." # in powershell
% python gpt.py
